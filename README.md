# Source code for Integrating Background Knowledge in Medical Semantic Segmentation with Logic Tensor Networks

Hi! This is the code used to produce the Result section of the paper reported in the title. Additional details (ArXiv link, .bib) are coming soonâ„¢.

## Notes

[Logic Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04422) have been developed for a couple of years so far, but I think there's still some potential left. 
In particular, I've never seen them applied to semantic segmentation, so I created a quick proof-of-concept that 
should highlight some of the advantages of having a neurosymbolic method applied to a common medical imaging task. 

Many thanks to my mate Tommaso Carraro who developed [LTNTorch](https://github.com/tommasocarraro/LTNtorch), making it a bit more accessible to develop LTN-based architectures with Pytorch.
